# Get started with the Power BI service
 
This tutorial is an introduction to some of the features of the Power BI service. In it, you connect to data, create a report and a dashboard, and ask questions of your data. You can do much more in the Power BI service; this tutorial is just to whet your appetite. For an understanding of how the Power BI service fits in with the other Power BI offerings, we recommend reading What is Power BI.

In this tutorial, you complete the following steps:

- Sign in to your Power BI online account, or sign up, if you don't have an account yet. 
- Open the Power BI service.
- Get some data and open it in report view.
- Use that data to create visualizations and save it as a report.
- Create a dashboard by pinning tiles from the report.
- Add other visualizations to your dashboard by using the Q&A natural-language tool.
- Resize, rearrange, and interact with the tiles on the dashboard.
- Clean up resources by deleting the dataset, report, and dashboard.


## Sign up for the Power BI service
### Step 1: Get data
Often when you want to create a Power BI report, you start in Power BI Desktop. This time, we're going to start from scratch creating a report in the Power BI service.

In this lab, we get data from a CSV file. [Download the Financial Sample CSV file.](Financial%20Sample.xlsx)

1. Sign in to Power BI. Power BI opens in  your browser. Select **Get data** at the bottom of the nav pane. The **Get Data** page opens.

2. Under the **Create new content** section, select **Files**.

4. Browse to the file on your computer, and choose **Open**.

5. For this tutorial, we select **Import** to add the Excel file as a dataset, which we can then use to create reports and dashboards. If you select **Upload**, the entire Excel workbook is uploaded to Power BI, where you can open and edit it in Excel online.

6. When your dataset is ready, select **Datasets**, then select **Create report** next to the dataset **Financial sample** to open the report editor.

The report canvas is blank. We see the **Filters**, **Visualizations**, and **Fields** panes on the right.

7. Notice there's an option for **Reading view** on the top nav pane. Because you have this option, that means you're currently in Editing view.

While in Editing view, you can create and modify your reports, because you're the *owner* of the report. That is, you're a *creator*. When you share your report with colleagues, they can only interact with the report in Reading view; your colleagues are *consumers*.

# [FCU] Data Visualization in Business Intelligence #

[Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/) was created to address the data explosion in commercial and academic organizations, the need to analyze that data, and the need for rich, interactive visuals to represent the data and reveal key insights. It contains a suite of tools that assist in the full life cycle of data analysis, from data discovery and collection to data transformation, aggregation, visualization, sharing, and collaboration. Moreover, it allows you to create rich visualizations without writing any code and present them in interactive dashboards.

Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to help you create, share, and consume business insights in the way that serves you and your business most effectively. The Microsoft Power BI service (app.powerbi.com), sometimes referred to as Power BI online, is the SaaS (Software as a Service) part of Power BI. 

In the Power BI service, dashboards help you keep a finger on the pulse of your business. Dashboards display tiles, which you can select to open reports for exploring further. Dashboards and reports connect to datasets that bring all of the relevant data together in one place.

In this lab, you will use Microsoft Power BI service to view sales data for a fictitious company and create reports and dashboards containing visualizations of that data. You will learn the basics of report creation and also learn various ways to share those reports with others, both internal and external to your organization.
